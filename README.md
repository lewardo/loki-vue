# loki-vue
## a simple website built with VueJS and served with Express on Node

to build navigate to `./client` and run `npm install; npm run build; rm -rf node_modules`
now that the website has been build and compiled into a static one, you can go and serve it using nodemon and express!
navigate to `./server` and run `npm install -g nodemon; npm install; npm start`
now go to [localhost](http://localhost) in you browser on port 80 (http)!
to exit nodemon type ^c in the terminal!
